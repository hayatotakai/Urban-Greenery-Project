Our research team and Boomforest discussed their progress and their goals for the Urban Forestry Project. Boomforest is an organization based in Paris that will be working with us to build our forest. They specialize in a reforestation process called the Miyawaki plantation method, whcih grows dense trees very quickly. Some upcoming goals that were discussed are securing a location for the park, reaching out to local communities for engagement, and researching native plant species.
